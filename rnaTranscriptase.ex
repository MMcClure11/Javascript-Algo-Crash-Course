# Given a DNA strand, return its RNA complement (per RNA transcription).

# Both DNA and RNA strands are a sequence of nucleotides.

# The four nucleotides found in DNA are adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G) and thymine (T).

# The four nucleotides found in RNA are adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G) and uracil (U).

# Given a DNA strand, its transcribed RNA strand is formed by replacing each nucleotide with its complement:

# G -> C
# C -> G
# T -> A
# A -> U
