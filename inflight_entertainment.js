// Build a feature for choosing two movies whose total runtimes will equal the exact flight length
// Write a fxn that takes an integer flightLength and an array of integers movieLengths (both in minutes)
// return a boolean indicating whether there are two nums in movieLengths whose sum equals flightLength

// assume watch exactly 2 movies
// don't make users watch same movie twice
// optimize for runtime over memory ( O(n)) where n is the length of movies
