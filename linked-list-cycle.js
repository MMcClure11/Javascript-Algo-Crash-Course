// common question asked by many big companies
//You are given a function hasCycle()
//which takes in a linked list called head
//determine if that linked list is a cycle (return true or false)

//consider a loop 1 -> 2-> 3-> 4-> 5-> (pointing back to 1)
// if you have a slow(moves 1 node) and fast pointer(moves 2 nodes) 
//check to see if they ever line up on the same node again
