Maximum Rating Sum
Ryan is movie obsessed and has a collected list of movie quality ratings. 
He wants to watch the largest contiguous list of movies with teh highest cumulative ratings possible. 
To do this, he must calculate the sum of all contiguous subarrays in order to determine the maximum possible subarray sum.

We can see that the highest contiguous subarray runs from arr[1]-arr[4] 
  and is 3 + 4 + -2 + 5 = 10
